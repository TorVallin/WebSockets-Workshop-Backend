Welcome to the backend!

All instructions for the workshop are found in the main repository, [WebSockets-Workshop](https://github.com/BusterWarn/WebSockets-Workshop), i.e. not this one!
You will not need to run the code in this repository on your own machine, a hosted version will be provided to you.

Here a very brief overview:
- The instructions for running the backend are found inside [backend/README.md](backend/README.md).
- [backend/message_types.py](backend/message_types.py) contains the message types that the frontend and backend uses to communicate.
- [backend/server.py](backend/server.py) and [backend/websocket_handlers.py](backend/websocket_handlers.py) contain the main logic for the websockets and the HTTP API.
